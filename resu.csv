Brief: WiproÃ¢Â€Â™s Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence_x000D_
technologiesÃ¢Â€Â”natural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform_x000D_
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and_x000D_
unstructured data sources; an Ã¢Â€Âœintent assessment and reasoningÃ¢Â€Â engine that includes sentiment and predictive_x000D_
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed_x000D_
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,_x000D_
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be_x000D_
eliminated._x000D_
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like_x000D_
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiÃ¢Â€Â™s and machine learning using_x000D_
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities._x000D_
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn_x000D_
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best_x000D_
suited response and make the system efficient._x000D_

Data warehouse division has multiple products for injecting, storing, analysing and presenting data. The Data Lake program is started to provide multi-talent, secure data hub to store application's data on Hadoop platform with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The object of the project is to provide necessary engineering support to analytics and application teams so that they can focus on the business logic development. In this project, the major task is to set up the Hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various Hadoop ecosystems. As the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it, Developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities._x000D_

Pfizer Inc. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City. The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application._x000D_

Pfizer Inc. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City. The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application._x000D_

Pfizer Inc. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City. The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application._x000D_

Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables.

For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables.

For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables.
